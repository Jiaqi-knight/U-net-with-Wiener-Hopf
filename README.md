# U-net-with-Wiener-Hopf
U-net with Wiener-Hopf method. 



The files are prepared for the demonstration in the artile: "Deep neural networks for waves assisted by the Wiener--Hopf method", which is under consideration by Royal Society Porceedings A. The official link of this article will be updated once the paper is published. 

Steps: 
0. Install Keras, etc. 
1. Download the training datasets A;
2. Download the testing datasets B;
3. Execute CNN_V6.py to train the model with A and then use the model to predict and compare with B.
