This folder is for th training data consisting of 300 datasets, which are prepared by our in-house Wiener-Hopf solver 
for duct acoustics. 

Note: The data is given here for demonstration. In our paper, a much larger datasets consisting of 10k various set-ups 
was actually used. Hence, readers of interest may:
1. download the data here to understand the working mechanisms;
2. then, develop their own database with bigger data to better utilize the proposed deep learning method. 

The current data file is still big, of size ~ 600 mB, and it is difficult for me to upload to github due to slow network
speed. Hence, I put the file on a separate cloud server. Readers of interest can access the datafile by clicking: 
https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_e0OnDCjXg6d0Xegr3nrhg 
and the password is: 452q

Please download the above file, and then use this by opening CNN_V6.py.

Last but not least, the file is put on the Baidu cloud and I have currently paid the fee to hold the space. But it may 
expire anytime...
